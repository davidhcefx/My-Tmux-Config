## Features:
- More intuitive. (eg. `+` to create panes, `Ctrl+C` to copy, `End` to move to end-of-line)
- System clipboard integration. (support: Cygwin and Unix X-Window)
- Your highlighted words will no longer disappear! They will remain until you click on the screen.

## Installation:
1. Install [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux), for example, via `apt-get install tmux`.
2. Put `.tmux.conf` under home directory `~/`.
3. If you are using the X-Window-Manager, be sure to install the CLI xclip.
